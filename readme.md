# Fly Me To The Moon - Launchpad Controller

This project allows a Launchpad controller to play "Fly Me To The Moon" by mapping each button to a segment of the song. When a button is pressed, the corresponding audio segment is played, and the LED lights of the Launchpad provide visual feedback based on the frequency and loudness of the audio.

## Features

- **Audio Processing:** Analyzes and plays audio segments with frequency and loudness feedback.
- **Launchpad Integration:** Full integration with the Launchpad, providing an interactive experience with responsive LED feedback.
- **Dynamic Sound Mapping:** Each button press corresponds to a specific segment of the song, allowing for a unique way to experience music.

## Installation

**Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nepyope/moon.git
   cd moon
   ```

**Usage**

Connect your Launchpad to the computer (only works launchpad mini :P).
Run the script:
```PYTHON
python moon.py
```

Enjoy playing! Press the buttons on your Launchpad to play segments of "Fly Me To The Moon.", by UR MUM $$
